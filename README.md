# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

# Aim
To analyse 'Mall customer Data' to achieve customer segmentation using unsupervised machine learning technique mainly K-Means clustering and Hierarchical clustering algorithm so that the understand marketing strategy works in real world.
# Objectives
Study the assosiation between different variable in data by using Testing of Hypothesis. Find out the number of clusters and also Find the cluster insights. 
# Methodology
Data collection: I have collected the 'Mall customer Data' from Kaggle.

Data Cleaning: In this step, prepare the data for further analysis by removing null values, transforming and standardizing our data.

Exploratory Data Analyis: After cleaning process we study the descriptive statistics, visualize data based on how they are related to each other.

Data Preprocessing: In this step, Feature selection, label encoding and feature scaling process is done.

Model Development: In this vary stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model.
# Tools and Technology Used:
Python and tableau

Jupyter Notebook

Python libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, scipy, seaborn etc.
# Conclusion
We have drawn many interesting inference from the dataset 'Mall customer data'. Here is summary of them

1. There is negative correlation between Age and Spending Score i.e. As age increases the spending score descreases.
2. There is no relation between Annual Income and spending score.
3. On the basis of Hypothesis Testing,

    i. Spending Score is indpendent of Gender.
    
    ii. Annual income is indpendent of Gender.
    
    iii. Age and spending score are dependent.
4. Cluster Insights
   All the clusters have almost identical annual income distributions.
   So, the customer clusters based on gender, age, and spending score.
    
        1. Low age females with high spending score
        
        2. Low age males with high spending score
        
        3. High age females with low spending score
        
        4. High age males with low spending score
        
5. Clusters generated using hierarchical clustering are similar to those generated using KMeans clustering.
